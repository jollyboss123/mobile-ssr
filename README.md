# Mobile server side rendering

### How to use
1. Create directory `Desktop/in` under your Home directory
2. Place json files with rendering details into `Desktop/in`, make sure files are versioned i.e. `xxx__v1.json`
3. Call from mobile GET `http://localhost:8081/get-flavor/{appId}`

### How it functions
1. User place json files for rendering in specified directory
2. Server will poll periodically & split json file into titles, color schemes & assets
3. Server then caches titles, color schemes & assets locally
4. User calls `getFlavor` API & retrieve from cache, if cache is empty retrieve from local directory
